You are working for an e-commerce company that sells various products. The company wants to implement a recommendation system to suggest products to users based on their past behavior (previously purchased items, items viewed, and product ratings). You need to design a basic recommendation system using Python.

Your task is to implement the following:

Data Representation:
You have a list of users, and each user has a list of products they have interacted with (either purchased or viewed). Each interaction can also have a rating (from 1 to 5).
Objective:
Implement a basic recommendation system that suggests products for a user based on their past interactions and similarities with other users.
Requirements:
Users who have similar product interactions should receive similar recommendations.
The recommendation should be based on collaborative filtering (user-based or item-based).
