2. What are Python decorators, and how do they work?
Answer: A decorator in Python is a function that allows you to modify the behavior of another function or method. It is used to "wrap" another function to extend its behavior without permanently modifying it. Decorators are commonly used for logging, access control, caching, and other cross-cutting concerns.
